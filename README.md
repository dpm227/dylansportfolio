# Dylan McClellan â€” [Portfolio](https://dpm227.github.io/dylansportfolio/#hero)

This is my personal developer portfolio built with **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Lucide Icons**.  
It showcases my projects, experience, and technical skills in a clean, responsive design.

## Inspiration
This portfolio was inspired by a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifOJ0R5UQOc) that provided the base layout and animation concepts.  
I customized it extensively by adding new sections, refining component structure, improving responsiveness,  
and integrating my personal branding and projects.
